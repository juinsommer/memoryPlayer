# MemoryPlayer
A GUI to use Tom Whitwell's SlowMovie `https://github.com/TomWhitwell/SlowMovie`.
This project was made as a gift and is not (yet) made very portable for users.
Updates are needed for better maintainability and end-user usability.

## Dependencies
- SlowMovie (on your RPI)
- Pyqt5
- qdarksytle

## Connecting to your Raspberry Pi
- Within `source/remote-settings.sh`, fill in `HOST` with your user and IP for your RPI enclosed in quotes.
